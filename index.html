-
rity. Freedom of the person shall be inviolable. These rights 
may be interfered with only pursuant to a law.

that now exist.

sex, parentage, race, language, homeland and origin, faith,

-
eral laws, in provisions for the protection of young persons,

The freedom of teaching shall not release any person from

Article 6
[Marriage – Family – Children]
  (1)
  Marriage and the family shall enjoy the special protection

Teachers may not be obliged against their will to give 
religious instruction.
  (4)
  The right to establish private schools shall be guaranteed. 
Private schools that serve as alternatives to state schools 
shall require the approval of the state and shall be subject 
to the laws of the 
Länder
. Such approval shall be given 
when private schools are not inferior to the state schools in 
terms of their educational aims, their facilities, or the pro
-
fessional training of their teaching staff, and when segrega
-
tion of pupils according to the means of their parents will 
not be encouraged thereby. Approval shall be withheld if 
the economic and legal position of the teaching staff is not 
adequately assured.
  (5)
  A private elementary school shall be approved only if the 
educational authority finds that it serves a special pedagog
-
ical interest or if, on the application of parents or guardi
-
ans, it is to be established as a denominational or interde
-
nominational school or as a school based on a particular 
philosophy and no state elementary school of that type 
exists in the municipality.
  (6)
  Preparatory schools shall remain abolished.
Article 8
[Freedom of assembly]
  (1)
  All Germans shall have the right to assemble peacefully 
and unarmed without prior notification or permission.

-
graphs (2) and (3) of Article 35, to paragraph (4) of Article

telecommunications]
  (1)

the federal territory.
  (2)

and only in cases in which the absence of adequate means 
of support would result in a particular burden for the com
-
munity, or in which such restriction is necessary to avert 
an imminent danger to the existence or the free democratic 
basic order of the Federation or of a 
Land
, to combat the 
danger of an epidemic, to respond to a grave accident or 
natural disaster, to protect young persons from serious ne
-
glect, or to prevent crime.</p>
